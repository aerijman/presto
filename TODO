Version 0.4.5  

High Priority  
+ Improve CollapseSeq algorithm for max_missing > 0
+ Add multiprocessing to CollapseSeq if needed after algorithm improvement
+ Try reduce overhead of sibling process exception detection in
  multiprocessing code.
+ Add copy fields and copy actions to BuildConsensus

Low Priority  
+ Optimize everything
+ Add --with-replacement parameter to sample and samplepair subcommands of
  SplitSeq allowing sampling with replacement
+ Add --decreasing parameter to sort subcommand of SplitSeq
+ Add flag for bidirectional annotation copying to PairSeq
+ Add --summary flag that generates count tables for plotting
+ Add sequence field option to table subcommand of ParseHeaders to allow
  addition of the sequence as a column of the table
+ Write two wrappers for server-side sequential processing of
  individual sequence records and sets of records which bypasses
  intermediate files

Potential Features  
+ Maybe add copy actions to AssemblePairs
+ Maybe add fail files to ParseLog and table subcommand of ParseHeaders
+ Maybe convert FASTA writing to use Bio.SeqIO.FastaIO(wrap=0)
+ Maybe add ParseLog subcommand that creates a summary table of counts
+ Maybe add a subcommand to SplitSeq enabling removal of a list of UIDs
+ Maybe add a purely positional barcode extraction mode to MaskPrimers
+ Maybe add --plot flag to enable output of summary plots
