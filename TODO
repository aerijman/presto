Version 0.4.5  

High Priority  
+ Improve CollapseSeq algorithm for max_missing > 0
+ Add multiprocessing to CollapseSeq if needed after algorithm improvement
+ Write two wrappers for server-side sequential processing of individual 
  sequence records and sets of records which bypassed intermediate files
+ Try reduce overhead of sibling process exception detection in
  multiprocessing code.

Low Priority  
+ Optimize everything
+ Add --with-replacement parameter to sample and samplepair subcommands of
  SplitSeq allowing sampling with replacement
+ Add --decreasing parameter to sort subcommand of SplitSeq
+ Add flag for bidirectional annotation copying to PairSeq
+ Add --summary flag that generates count tables for plotting
  
Potential Features  
+ Maybe add --start parameter to align subcommand of MaskPrimers
+ Maybe import ParseDB tool into pRESTO to convert csv/tab files to
  FASTA/CLIP format
+ Maybe add fail files to ParseLog and table subcommand of ParseHeaders
+ Maybe add copy fields/actions to BuildConsensus and AssemblePairs
+ Maybe convert FASTA writing to use Bio.SeqIO.FastaIO(wrap=0)
+ Maybe add ParseLog subcommand that creates a summary table of counts
+ Maybe add a subcommand to SplitSeq enabling removal of a list of UIDs
+ Maybe add a purely positional barcode extraction mode to MaskPrimers
+ Maybe add --plot flag to enable output of summary plots
