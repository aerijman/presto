Version 0.4.1

High Priority
+ Add clean termination of workers processes when exceptions occur
+ Improve CollapseSeq algorithm for max_missing > 0
+ Add multiprocessing to CollapseSeq if needed after algorithm improvement
+ Write two wrappers for server-side sequential processing of individual 
  sequence records and sets of records which bypassed intermediate files
+ Test on Windows
+ Test on Os X

Low Priority
+ Add --start parameter to align subcommand of MaskPrimers
+ Optimize everything
+ Maybe add fail files to ParseLog and table subcommand of ParseHeaders
+ Maybe add copy fields/actions to BuildConsensus and AssemblePairs
+ Maybe convert FASTA writing to use Bio.SeqIO.FastaIO(wrap=0)
+ Maybe add parameter to sample and samplepair subcommands of SplitSeq
  allowing sampling with replacement
+ Maybe convert args and results dictionaries passed through 
  multiprocessing Queue to classes
