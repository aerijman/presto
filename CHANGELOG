Version 0.4.0

Minor name changes were made to multiple scripts, functions, parameters,
  and output files

AlignSets, AssemblePairs, BuildConsensus, EstimateError, FilterSeq, and 
  MaskPrimers are now multithreaded.  The number of simultaneous processes
  may be specified using '--nproc (value)'. Note this means file ordering
  is no longer preserved between the input and output sequence files.

Performance improvements were made to several tools.

The universal '--verbose' parameter was replaced with '--log (file name)'
  which specifies a log file for verbose output, and disables verbose logging
  if not specified.  

The report of input parameters and sequence counts is now separate from the log
  and is always printed to standard output.

Added a progress bar to the standard output of most tools.
  
Added a universal '--outname (file prefix)' parameter which changes the leading
  portion of the output file name.  If not specified, the current file name 
  is used (excluding the file extension, as per the previous behavior).

Added a universal '--clean' parameter which if specified forces the tool not to
  create an output file of sequences which failed processing.
  
IgCore:
+ Changes to parameters and internals of multiple functions
+ Added functions to support multithreading for single-end reads, paired-end 
  reads, and barcode sets
+ Added safe annotation field renaming
+ Added progress bar, logging and output file name conversion support
+ Moved reusable AssemblePairs, BuildConsensus, PairSeq, and SplitSeq 
  operations into IgCore

AssemblePairs:
+ Coordinate information is now specified by a coordinate type, rather than a 
  delimiter, using the '--coord (header type)' parameter, where the header type
  may be one of (illumina, solexa, sra, 454, presto)

CollapseSeq:
+ Sequences with a missing character count exceeding the user limit defined
  by '-n (maximum missing count)' are now exported to a separate 
  'collapse-undetermined' output file, rather than included in the 
  'collapse-unique' sequence output.

EstimateError:
+ Now outputs error estimations for positions, quality scores, nucleotide 
  pairs, and annotation sets.  
+ Machine reported quality scores and empiracle quality scores have been added
  to all output tables.

FilterSeq:
+ Added 'length' subcommand to filter sequences by minimum length 


PairSeq:
+ Coordinate information has been redefined as per AssemblePairs.

ParseHeaders:
+ Added new subcommand 'convert' which attempts to reformat sequence headers 
  into the pRESTO format.
+ The 'rename' subcommand will now append entries if the new field name already
  exists in the sequence header, rather than replace the entry.

Version 0.3 (prerelease 6)

Toolkit is now dependent upon pandas 0.12 for the estimateError tool.

alignSets:
+ Changed MUSCLE execution to faster settings ('-diags', '-maxiters 2')

filterQuality:
+ Added 'repeat' subcommand to filter sequences with '-n (value)' repetitions 
  of a single character and 
+ Changed '-n' parameter of 'ambig' subcommand from fractional value to a 
  raw count

estimateError:
+ New tool which estimates error of sequence sets by comparison to a consensus

maskPrimers:
+ Bug fixes to alignment position calculation of 'align' subcommand when primer
  alignment begins before start of sequence
+ Removed '--vann' parameter

IgPipeline Core:
+ Bug fixes to diversity calculation
+ Added support for files where all sequences do not share the same annotation 
  fields
+ Added support for alternate scoring of gap and N-valued nucleotides

alignSets:
+ Added '--mode' parameter with options of 'pad' and 'cut' to specify whether 
  to extend or trim read groups to the same start position
+ Fixed intermittent 'muscle' subcommand stdout pipe deadlock when 
  executing MUSCLE

assemblePairs:
+ Added 'join' subcommand to support library preps where paired-end reads 
  do not overlap
+ Speed improvements to p-value calculations

buildConsensus:
+ '--div' parameter converted to '--maxdiv (value)' to allow filtering of read 
  groups by diversity
+ Bug fixes to nucleotide frequency consensus method
+ '-q' parameter renamed to '--qual'

collapseSequences:
+ Added support for files where all sequences do not share the same annotation 
  fields

splitSeqFile:
+ 'samplepair' subcommand added to allow random sampling from paired-end 
  file sets
+ The behavior of the '-c' parameter of the 'sample' and 'samplepair' 
  subcommands changed to allow multiple samplings with the same command
