Version 0.4.2

Increased verbosity of exception reporting

IgCore:
+ Updates to consensus functions to support changes to BuildConsensus

BuildConsensus:
+ Added support for '--freq (value)' parameter to quality consensus method 
+ Fixed a bug in the frequency consensus method where missing values were
  contributing to the total character count at each position
+ Added the parameter '--maxmiss (value)' which provides a cut-off for removal 
  of positions with too many N or gap characters. 

SplitSeq:
+ Removed convert subcommand

Version 0.4.1

Changes to the internals of multiple tools to provide support for 
  multiprocessing in Windows environments.
Changes to the internals of multiple tools to provide clean exit of
  child processes upon kill signal or exception in sibling process 
Fixed unexpected behavior of --outname and --log arguments with 
  multiple input files

IgCore:
+ Added reporting of unknown exceptions when reading sequence files
+ Fixed scoring of lowercase sequences

AlignSets:
+ Fixed a typo in the log output

BuildConsensus:
+ Fixed a typo in the log output

EstimateError:
+ Fixed bug where tool would improperly exit if no sets passed threshold
  criteria.
+ Fixed typo in console output

MaskPrimers:
+ Added 'trim' mode which will cut the region before primer alignment, but 
  leave primer region unmodified.
+ Fixed a bug with lowercase sequence data
+ Fixed bug in the console and log output
+ Added support for primer matching when setting '--maxerr 1.0'

ParseHeaders:
+ Added count of sequences without any valid fields (FAIL) to console output

ParseLog:
+ Added count of records without any valid fields (FAIL) to console output

SplitSeq:
+ Fixed typo in console output of samplepair subcommand
+ Added increase of the open file limit to the group subcommand to allow for a 
  large number of groups

September 30, 2013
Version 0.4.0

Minor name changes were made to multiple scripts, functions, parameters,
  and output files

AlignSets, AssemblePairs, BuildConsensus, EstimateError, FilterSeq, and 
  MaskPrimers are now multithreaded.  The number of simultaneous processes
  may be specified using '--nproc (value)'. Note this means file ordering
  is no longer preserved between the input and output sequence files.

Performance improvements were made to several tools.

The universal '--verbose' parameter was replaced with '--log (file name)'
  which specifies a log file for verbose output, and disables verbose logging
  if not specified.  

The report of input parameters and sequence counts is now separate from the log
  and is always printed to standard output.

Added a progress bar to the standard output of most tools.
  
Added a universal '--outname (file prefix)' parameter which changes the leading
  portion of the output file name.  If not specified, the current file name 
  is used (excluding the file extension, as per the previous behavior).

Added a universal '--clean' parameter which if specified forces the tool not to
  create an output file of sequences which failed processing.
  
IgCore:
+ Changes to parameters and internals of multiple functions
+ Added functions to support multithreading for single-end reads, paired-end 
  reads, and barcode sets
+ Added safe annotation field renaming
+ Added progress bar, logging and output file name conversion support
+ Moved reusable AssemblePairs, BuildConsensus, PairSeq, and SplitSeq 
  operations into IgCore

AssemblePairs:
+ Coordinate information is now specified by a coordinate type, rather than a 
  delimiter, using the '--coord (header type)' parameter, where the header type
  may be one of (illumina, solexa, sra, 454, presto)

CollapseSeq:
+ Sequences with a missing character count exceeding the user limit defined
  by '-n (maximum missing count)' are now exported to a separate 
  'collapse-undetermined' output file, rather than included in the 
  'collapse-unique' sequence output.

EstimateError:
+ Now outputs error estimations for positions, quality scores, nucleotide 
  pairs, and annotation sets.  
+ Machine reported quality scores and empirical quality scores have been added
  to all output tables.

FilterSeq:
+ Added 'length' subcommand to filter sequences by minimum length 

PairSeq:
+ Coordinate information has been redefined as per AssemblePairs.

ParseHeaders:
+ Added new subcommand 'convert' which attempts to reformat sequence headers 
  into the pRESTO format.
+ The 'rename' subcommand will now append entries if the new field name already
  exists in the sequence header, rather than replace the entry.

Version 0.3 (prerelease 6)

Toolkit is now dependent upon pandas 0.12 for the estimateError tool.

alignSets:
+ Changed MUSCLE execution to faster settings ('-diags', '-maxiters 2')

filterQuality:
+ Added 'repeat' subcommand to filter sequences with '-n (value)' repetitions 
  of a single character and 
+ Changed '-n' parameter of 'ambig' subcommand from fractional value to a 
  raw count

estimateError:
+ New tool which estimates error of sequence sets by comparison to a consensus

maskPrimers:
+ Bug fixes to alignment position calculation of 'align' subcommand when primer
  alignment begins before start of sequence
+ Removed '--vann' parameter
