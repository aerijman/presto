Tool	Subcommand	Description
:ref:`AlignSets`		Multiple aligns sets of sequences sharing the same annotation
	muscle	Uses the program MUSCLE to align reads
	offset	Uses a table of primer alignments to pad or cleave the 5' unaligned region
	table	Creates a table for use by the offset subcommand via alignment of the primers
:ref:`AssemblePairs`		Assembles paired-end reads into a complete sequence
	align	Assembles a single full length sequence by aligning the ends of paired-end sequences
	join	Concatenates reads with intervening gaps for paired-end reads that do not overlap
	reference	Assembles non-overlapping paired-ends by aligning against the V-region references
:ref:`BuildConsensus`		Constructs a consensus sequence from sets sharing the same annotation (UMI)
:ref:`ClusterSets`		Clusters sequences by annotation (UMI) into smaller sub-groups
:ref:`CollapseSeq`		Removes duplicate sequences
:ref:`ConvertHeaders`		Converts sequence headers to the pRESTO format
	generic	Converts sequence headers without a known annotation system
	454	Converts Roche 454 sequence headers
	genbank	Converts NCBI GenBank and RefSeq sequence headers
	illumina	Converts Illumina sequence headers
	imgt	Converts sequence headers output by IMGT/GENE-DB.
	sra	Converts NCBI SRA sequence headers
:ref:`EstimateError`		Estimates error rates for sets of reads sharing the same annotation
:ref:`FilterSeq`		Filters sequences to high quality reads according to user-defined thresholds
	length	Removes sequences under a defined length
	maskqual	Masks low Phred quality score positions with Ns
	missing	Removes sequences with a high number of Ns
	repeats	Removes sequences with long repeats of a single nucleotide
	quality	Removes sequences with low Phred quality scores
	trimqual	Trims sequences to segments with high Phred quality scores
:ref:`MaskPrimers`		Trims or masks primer/barcode sequences and annotates reads accordingly
	align	Identifies primer regions by local alignment and reorients sequences
	score	Matches primers at a fixed user-defined start position
:ref:`PairSeq`		Sorts paired-end reads and copies annotations between them
:ref:`ParseHeaders`		Manipulates sequence annotations
	add	Adds a field and value annotation pair to all reads
	collapse	Compresses a set of annotation fields into a single field
	copy	Copies values between annotations fields
	delete	Deletes an annotation from all reads
	expand	Expands an annotation with multiple values into multiple different annotations
	rename	Rename annotation fields
	table	Outputs sequence annotations as a data table
:ref:`ParseLog`		Converts the log output of pRESTO scripts into data tables
:ref:`SplitSeq`		Performs conversion, sorting, and subsetting of sequence files
	count	Splits files into separate files containing a maximum number of reads
	group	Splits files based on the values in either a textual or numeric annotation field
	sample	Randomly samples sequences from a file
	samplepair	Randomly samples paired-end reads from two files
	sort	Sorts sequences within a file based on the values in an annotation field
